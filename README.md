# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

I have created a quiz with 6 questions through HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Pressing the "Begin Quiz!" button will initiate the quiz. Clicking on a correct answer will increase the score counter by 1. There is a countdown timer of 60 seconds which starts when the quiz begins. I thought 60 seconds was enough because the quiz is not particularly long. Incorrectly answering a question will reduce the remaining time by 10 seconds. The game is over either when all questions have been answered, or time runs out. At the end of the countdown timer, a surprise will show on the screen.
